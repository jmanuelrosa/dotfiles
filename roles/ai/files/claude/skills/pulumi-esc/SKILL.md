# Pulumi ESC (Environments, Secrets, and Configuration)

Pulumi ESC is a centralized service for managing environments, secrets, and configuration across cloud infrastructure and applications.

## What is ESC?

ESC enables teams to:

- **Centralize secrets and configuration** in one secure location
- **Compose environments** by importing and layering configuration
- **Generate dynamic credentials** via OIDC for AWS, Azure, GCP
- **Integrate external secret stores** (AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, Vault, 1Password)
- **Version and audit** all configuration changes
- **Control access** with fine-grained RBAC

## Essential CLI Commands

```bash
# Create a new environment
pulumi env init <org>/<project-name>/<environment-name>

# Edit environment (opens in editor)
pulumi env edit <org>/<project-name>/<environment-name>

# Set values
pulumi env set <org>/<project-name>/<environment-name> <key> <value>
pulumi env set <org>/<project-name>/<environment-name> <key> <value> --secret

# View definition (secrets hidden)
pulumi env get <org>/<project-name>/<environment-name>

# Open and resolve (reveals secrets)
pulumi env open <org>/<project-name>/<environment-name>

# Run command with environment
pulumi env run <org>/<project-name>/<environment-name> -- <command>

# Link to Pulumi stack
pulumi config env add <project-name>/<environment-name>
```

## Key Concepts

### Command Distinctions

- **`pulumi env get`**: Shows static definition, secrets appear as `[secret]`
- **`pulumi env open`**: Resolves and reveals all values including secrets and dynamic credentials
- **`pulumi env run`**: Executes commands with environment variables loaded
- **`pulumi config env add`**: Only takes the <project-name>/<environment-name> portion

### Environment Structure

Environments are YAML documents with reserved top-level keys:

- **`imports`**: Import and compose other environments
- **`values`**: Define configuration and secrets

Reserved sub-keys under `values`:

- **`environmentVariables`**: Map values to shell environment variables
- **`pulumiConfig`**: Configure Pulumi stack settings
- **`files`**: Generate files with environment data

### Basic Example

```yaml
imports:
  - common/base-config

values:
  environment: production
  region: us-west-2

  dbPassword:
    fn::secret: super-secure-password

  environmentVariables:
    AWS_REGION: ${region}
    DB_PASSWORD: ${dbPassword}

  pulumiConfig:
    aws:region: ${region}
    app:dbPassword: ${dbPassword}
```

### Reading Another Stack's Outputs

Use the `fn::open::pulumi-stacks` provider to consume another stack's outputs. The
`stacks` and `network` keys below are arbitrary names you choose. Once the function
resolves, it *replaces* `stacks.network` with the named stack's outputs — so the
output names (`vpcId`, `subnetIds`) do not appear in the static YAML; they come from
whatever the producer stack exports. Two things are easy to get wrong:

- The stack is named by a single project-qualified `stack: <project>/<stackName>`
  field — **not** separate `projectName`/`stackName` fields.
- Outputs resolve directly under the stack name — there is **no** `.outputs.` level
  (use `${stacks.network.vpcId}`, not `${stacks.network.outputs.vpcId}`).

Example — replace the stack name and output names with your own:

```yaml
values:
  stacks:
    fn::open::pulumi-stacks:
      stacks:
        network:                 # arbitrary local name for the referenced stack
          stack: my-project/dev  # producer stack to read outputs from
  pulumiConfig:
    # vpcId / subnetIds are whatever the producer stack exports; after the function
    # resolves they are available directly under `stacks.network` (no `.outputs.`).
    vpcId: ${stacks.network.vpcId}
    subnetIds: ${stacks.network.subnetIds}
```

### Viewing an Environment in the Pulumi Cloud Console

The console URL for an environment is
`https://app.pulumi.com/<org>/esc/<project>/<environment>`. The route segment is
`esc`, not `environments`.

## Working with the User

### For Simple Questions

If the user asks basic questions like "How do I create an environment?" or "What's the difference between get and open?", answer directly using the information above.

### For Detailed Documentation

When users need more information, use the web-fetch tool to get content from the official Pulumi ESC documentation:

- **Complete YAML syntax and functions** → https://www.pulumi.com/docs/esc/environments/syntax/
- **Provider integrations** (AWS, Azure, GCP, Vault, 1Password):
  - AWS: https://www.pulumi.com/docs/esc/integrations/dynamic-login-credentials/aws-login/
  - Azure: https://www.pulumi.com/docs/esc/integrations/dynamic-login-credentials/azure-login/
  - GCP: https://www.pulumi.com/docs/esc/integrations/dynamic-login-credentials/gcp-login/
  - Short-term credential (OIDC) providers: https://www.pulumi.com/docs/esc/integrations/dynamic-login-credentials/
  - Dynamic secret providers: https://www.pulumi.com/docs/esc/integrations/dynamic-secrets/
  - Pulumi stack outputs (`fn::open::pulumi-stacks`): https://www.pulumi.com/docs/esc/providers/pulumi-stacks/
  - All providers (index): https://www.pulumi.com/docs/esc/providers/
- **Getting started guide** → https://www.pulumi.com/docs/esc/get-started/
- **CLI reference** → https://www.pulumi.com/docs/esc/cli/commands/
  - Prefer using the `pulumi env` subcommands over `esc` CLI.

Use the web-fetch tool with specific prompts to extract relevant information from these docs.

### For Complex Tasks

When helping users:

1. **Understand the goal**: Are they setting up new environments, migrating from stack config, or debugging?
2. **Check existing setup**: Use `pulumi env` commands to list environments or read definitions
3. **Fetch relevant documentation**: Use the web-fetch to get specific examples or syntax from the official docs
4. **Provide step-by-step guidance**: Walk through the process with specific commands
5. **Validate**: Help them test with `pulumi env get` or `pulumi preview`
  a. Only use `pulumi env open` when the full resolved values are needed, but use cautiously as it reveals secrets.

### Example: Helping with AWS OIDC Setup

```text
User: "How do I set up AWS OIDC credentials in ESC?"

1. Use the web-fetch tool to get AWS OIDC documentation from "https://www.pulumi.com/docs/esc/integrations/dynamic-login-credentials/aws-login/"
2. Provide the user with the configuration
3. Ask the user if they have a pre-defined role or need one created for them
4. Set up as much of the environment as possible, then guide them through any steps that you can't do for them
5. Help them test with `pulumi env get` or `pulumi env open` if necessary
```

## Common Workflows

### Creating an Environment

```bash
pulumi env init my-org/my-project/dev-config
# Edit environment (accepts new definition from a file, better for agents, more difficult for users)
pulumi env edit --file /tmp/example.yml my-org/my-project/dev-config
```

### Linking to Stack

```bash
pulumi config env add my-project/dev-config
pulumi config  # Verify environment values are accessible
```

### API Access (Rare)

**Always prefer CLI commands.** Only use the API when absolutely necessary (e.g., bulk operations, automation).

Available API endpoints include:

- `GET /api/esc/environments/{orgName}` - List environments
- `GET /api/esc/environments/{orgName}/{projectName}/{envName}` - Read environment definition
- `GET /api/esc/providers?orgName={orgName}` - List available providers

Use the `pulumi api` CLI subcommand to make requests when needed, e.g. `pulumi api /api/esc/providers -F orgName={orgName}`.

## Best Practices

1. Always use `fn::secret` for sensitive values
2. Prefer OIDC over static keys
3. Use descriptive names like `<org>/my-app/production-aws` not `<org>/app/prod`
4. Layer environments: base → cloud-provider → stack-specific
5. Verify that `pulumi config` shows expected values after linking an environment to a stack
6. Prefer using `pulumi env run` for commands needing environment variables
7. Only use `pulumi env open` when absolutely necessary, as it reveals secrets
8. Before using an existing environment, verify its account and role and get the user's confirmation; never select one by name alone. Never link an environment to a stack (`pulumi config env add`) without explicit user confirmation, and never pass `--yes`.

## Handling Credential Errors and Existing Environments

### Credential errors

Start with the remediation in the error message. An expired or missing login
usually just needs the user to re-authenticate, and most providers name the fix
or the command:

- AWS SSO: `Failed to refresh cached SSO credentials. Please refresh SSO login.`
  → `aws sso login`
- AWS temporary credentials: `ExpiredToken: The security token included in the
  request is expired` → refresh the session or keys
- Azure: re-run `az login`
- GCP: re-run `gcloud auth application-default login`
- Pulumi Cloud (401 / unauthorized): `pulumi login`

Relay the fix and have the user retry. If the error does not name a remediation
(for example a bare `Unable to locate credentials`, or an access-denied that may
mean the wrong account or profile rather than an expired login), don't guess —
identify how the project authenticates (provider config, the active profile, any
linked ESC environment) and address that.

Changing where the project gets its credentials (adding or switching an ESC
environment, editing provider config) is a deliberate change, not a reflexive
fix for an expired session. Do it only if the user wants it, and follow the
rules below.

### Never select an existing environment by name

Do not pick an environment because its name looks relevant (`*-aws-oidc`,
`*-creds`, `*-workshop`, etc.). A matching name does not mean it is the right
one or that it belongs to this user's work.

Before proposing any existing environment:

1. Inspect it with `pulumi env get <org>/<project>/<env>`.
2. Confirm the target it authenticates to matches where the user's resources
   actually live. An OIDC `roleArn` names a specific AWS account — if it points
   at a different account (a shared workshop, an instructor role, another team),
   it is the wrong environment and will run operations against the wrong account
   or fail.
3. Show the candidate to the user and confirm it is theirs and correct before
   using it.

### Linking an environment changes which credentials operations use — confirm first

`pulumi config env add` edits the stack config (`Pulumi.<stack>.yaml`) and
changes the credentials Pulumi operations run under. Never run it without
explicit user confirmation, and never pass `--yes` to skip that confirmation.
Tell the user what will change and let them decide.

### Verify before claiming it worked

After linking, resolved credential values often show as `[unknown]` until the
environment is opened or run. Do not claim the error is fixed or that the next
operation will succeed until you have verified it — check `pulumi config`, and
confirm the credentials resolve to the expected account before declaring success.

### Quick troubleshooting

- **"Environment not found"**: Check permissions with `pulumi env ls -o <org>`
- **"Secret decryption failed"**: Use `pulumi env open` not `pulumi env get`
- **"Stack can't read values"**: Verify `pulumi config env ls` to ensure the stack is listed.
  - Ensure the environment is referenced only by the project-name/environment-name format.
  - Get the specific environment definition with `pulumi env get <org>/<project-name>/<environment-name>`.
  - Verify the `pulumiConfig` key exists and is nested under the `values` key.
