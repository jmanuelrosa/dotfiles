# jmanuelrosa's dotfiles

ïŸ™ A set of configurations, applications and tweaks for Arch Linux

## Packages Overview

* [System](./roles/system/tasks/main.yml) packages

## Installation

**Warning**: These dotfiles are well tested with Arch Linux and should work *ONLY* with Arch Linux. If you want to try it with another Linux distribution, you should use the packaging tool for your Linux distribution, such as the [apt module](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/apt_module.html#ansible-collections-ansible-builtin-apt-module) for Debian.

### No dependencies
You don't need to do anything to install the dotfiles in this way, just run the bootstrap script and it will do the rest.

```
> mkdir dotfiles
> cd dotfiles
> bash <(curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jmanuelrosa/dotfiles/main/bootstrap.sh)
```

### Using Ansible and Git

If you want to manage the dotfiles by yourself, you can download and run them with Ansible. In this case, you'll need to install git, ansible, and some plugins.

for linux
```
> sudo pacman -S git ansible
```

for Mac
```
> brew install ansible git
```

```
> ansible-galaxy collection install community.general
> mkdir dotfiles
> cd dotfiles
> git clone git@github.com:jmanuelrosa/dotfiles.git . &> /dev/nul
> ansible-playbook --inventory inventory.yml --ask-vault-password --ask-become-pass dotfiles.yml
```

## Tools

### Common
* [bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat): A cat(1) clone with wings
* [glances](https://github.com/nicolargo/glances): A top/htop alternative for GNU/Linux, BSD, Mac OS and Windows operating systems.
* github: ... you know it

### Linux
* [yay](https://github.com/Jguer/yay): A powerful AUR Helper written in Go to use as an alternative to Pacman

### Mac

## Testing

Instead to run the dotfiles in your current machine all time that we change or update a config, you can test these playbooks with Vagrant. There is a Vagrant file configuration with the minimum required (an empty arch installation).

The first that you need is to install the dependencies:

for linux:
```
> yay -S vagrant virtualbox ansible
```

for mac
```
> brew install --cask vagrant virtualbox && brew install ansible
```

After install all dependencies, you can choose to run the GUI or not to see Sway and Wayland in action.

If you want to run Vagrant in headless mode, you need to run it with:

```
> vagrant up
```

If you want to run Vagrant with the GUI and see how beautiful Sway is and how it works in Wayland, you can run:


```
> GUI=true vagrant up
```

### Install Guest additions on Vagrant

```
> vagrant ssh -c "sudo pacman --remove --noconfirm virtualbox-guest-utils-nox"
> vagrant ssh -c "sudo pacman --sync --quiet --noconfirm virtualbox-guest-utils virtualbox-guest-iso"
> vagrant reload
> vagrant ssh -c "sudo mount -t iso9660 -o loop /usr/lib/virtualbox/additions/VBoxGuestAdditions.iso /mnt"
> vagrant ssh -c "sudo yes | sudo sh /mnt/VBoxLinuxAdditions.run --accept"
> vagrant reload
> vagrant ssh -c "sudo /sbin/rcvboxadd quicksetup all"
```

## Errors

### Vagrant errors

* `VERR_VMX_MSR_ALL_VMX_DISABLED` error whrn try to run `vagrant up`, you need to active virtualization in your BIOS. You need to active
  * Intel Virtualization technology
  * Intel VT-d Feature

* If you get an error related to `vboxdrv`, run `sudo modprobe vboxdrv` to add this module to the kernel. For this, you should have installed `linux-lts-headers`.

## Packages

According to [this](https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/543025bin) information, better install `bin` or `git` packages.


## Other settings

There are some settings that we can't do it using the CLI for mac or other apps, so you need to change this settings by hand, and using the UI.

### Mac
* Disable allpaper click and show desktop.

  `Cmd + space` and look for `Desktop & dock`. Go to `Click wallapaper to reveal desktop` and set to `Only in State Manager`.

### Docker

Sometimes happens you can get an error based on `error getting credentials`. To fix this problem, you can install `docker-credential-helper`:

```bash
> brew install docker-credential-helper
```

### DBeaver configuration
* Set the timezone to UTC:

  DBeaver > Settings > User Interface > Timezone
* Disable date formating

    DBeaver > Settings > Editors > Data Editor > Data Formats

    Check 'Disable date/time formatting'
